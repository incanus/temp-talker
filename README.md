# Temp Talker

A small [CircuitPython](https://circuitpython.org) app that I wrote for Adafruit's [Circuit Playground Express](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3333) which features (among other things), a thermistor, buttons, and a speaker. 

Press either button to hear a voice speak the temperature. You can also send a byte over the USB serial connection to trigger the output. 

Sound clips made using the macOS built-in `say` command.
